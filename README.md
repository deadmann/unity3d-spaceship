When I was a collage student, I got familiar with Unity3D (v2.5), and I really enjoyed scripting in it, even though I didn't done much.
Due to lack of people who where familiar with Unity3D at that time, and having a hard time finding a new job, I had to part away from this path and I entered the way of windows application development, and after that Web and Services development.
So, I slowly forgot how it look like coding in Unity, and I trully missed it a lot.
My working exprience in this path, and living condition and life expenses also doesn't allow me to go back, So now that I find a few days free time, I wanted to exprience once again being in Unity environment, coding, and working with UI (inspector, project, settings, scene, ...).

The initial commit that I pushed to github is a ~5 day work project. that I had to re-train my self, and also check my choice with tutorials, or even learn new things in youtube to be able to make them.

I also look forward to add enemy if I find time, but as most of my time goes for company, and the rest mostly goes for a parallel project that I have to finish, I'm afraid if I ever do that.
